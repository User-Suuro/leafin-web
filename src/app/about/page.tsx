          <p className="mb-4">
            Lettuce is one of the most popular and successful crops for aquaponics
            systems due to its fast growth rate, low maintenance requirements, and
            adaptability to hydroponic environments. It is a cool-season leafy
            vegetable that thrives in water-based systems like deep water culture
            (DWC) or nutrient film technique (NFT), where its roots have constant
            access to oxygenated, nutrient-rich water.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an aquaponics setup, lettuce benefits from the natural nutrients
            provided by fish waste, eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers.
            It typically reaches harvest size in 30 to 45 days, depending on the
            variety and environmental conditions. Lettuce also helps maintain water
            balance and offers a visual indicator of system health due to its
            sensitivity to changes in pH and nutrient levels.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Tilapia is one of the most widely used fish species in aquaponics due
            to its resilience, fast growth rate, and ability to thrive in controlled
            environments. Native to Africa, tilapia are freshwater fish that can
            tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including fluctuations in
            temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen levels. This hardiness makes them
            an excellent choice for beginners and experienced aquaponics
            practitioners alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an aquaponics system, tilapia serve as the primary nutrient source
            for the plants. As the fish are fed, they produce waste that is
            converted by beneficial bacteria into nitratesâ€”an essential nutrient
            for plant growth. This natural nutrient cycle supports both the health
            of the fish and the productivity of the plants, creating a balanced,
            symbiotic environment.

        Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a fast-growing freshwater fish ideal
        for aquaponics. It is hardy, easy to maintain, and thrives in varied water
        conditions. In the system, tilapia will be kept in tanks with sensors for
        pH, temperature, and oxygen, and fed using an automated feeder.

        Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grows well in aquaponic setups due to its low
        nutrient needs and quick growth. It will be planted in rafts or channels
        where roots absorb nutrients from fish waste. Sensors will help maintain
        water quality for optimal plant health.

        The Aquaponics System connects fish and plant production in a sustainable
        cycle. Fish provide nutrients for the plants, while plants help filter
        the water. With automated monitoring and feeding, the system ensures
        balanced growth with less manual work.
